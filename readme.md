# Weapon detection

This project is my thesis project for my graduation in mechatronics engineering at the Universidad Cat√≥lica Boliviana "San Pablo" in La Paz, Bolivia. This project includes a web application, a mobile application and a neural network that detects weapons in images and videos. The neural network was trained using the YOLOv5 model and the final deployment for the model is an IoT node hosted on a Jetson Nano, all the code to deploy the model is in the this [repository](https://github.com/Rod5919/Weapon-detector).
